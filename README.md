# cc-18-lottery-number-generator
Codecademy Project #18 - HTML/CSS/JS - Create an app that takes inputs and outputs something from scratch

I chose to go with a lottery number generator that takes a few inputs and uses these inputs to get a certain range of outputs.
The numbers are still random for the biggest part but the inputs alter the range, multipliers etc. that are used to generate these numbers.
